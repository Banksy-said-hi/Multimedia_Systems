# Multimedia_Systems
- This repository is home to the scripts that were meant to solve the assignments given in the multimedia systems class on Mondays

# Final Project 
- The file "PSNR" is the final project running which results in a number representing PSNR ratio of the compression operated by the script.

  
**The script upon execution accepts an integer as a compression level from the user**
